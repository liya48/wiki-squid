    <p>Squid Game (Korean: 오징어 게임) is a South Korean dystopian survival thriller horror television series created, written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk">Hwang Dong-hyuk</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a> The series revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion (US$39.86 million) prize. The series' title draws from ojingeo ("squid"), a Korean children's game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae">Lee Jung-jae</a>, who portrays series protagonist Seong Gi-hun, leads an ensemble cast.</p>
    <p>Hwang conceived the idea based on his own economic struggles, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism<sup>[8][9]</sup> Although he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang could not find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.</p>
